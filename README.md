## Welcome to Preluvs: Your Hub for Preloved Books!

At Preluvs, we've crafted a web-based haven exclusively for preloved books. Our journey began with the realization that the buying and selling of used books lacked a centralized platform, especially compared to the more common offline used bookstores. Preluvs aims to simplify the process for book enthusiasts to effortlessly trade their preloved books, ensuring that each book finds a new home and remains a source of knowledge and enjoyment for others. We're here to unite the book-loving community through the Preluvs platform.
